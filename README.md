# Rock-Paper-Scissors [by Debris]

**Rock-Paper-Scissors** (abbreviated as **RPS**) is a faction mod for the game Reassembly. The end goal is to create three factions designed for competitive play, which will eventually be called Rock, Paper, and Scissors.

## Deviations From Vanilla Faction Philosophy:

A few base Reassembly features have been removed entirely for the sake of simplicity.
- **No generator blocks.** The faction cores generate ridiculous amounts of energy already and other modules use next to nothing.
- **Homing Launchables are nonexistent.** Don't expect to use a lot of launchables. Don't expect to use a lot of PD either.

Other things have been changed from the vanilla factions as well.
- **Function of shields is different.** Regen times are fast, health is low. Downtime is long. Large shots and bursts can destroy them, but not much else.
- **Mass, health, and P are scaled differently.** That is, RPS is not designed to be compatible with vanilla designs.
- **Block IDs are not sequential.** In order to make it easier to add blocks into the faction, IDs will be spaced 2 units apart. Different types of blocks may be differentiated by about 100 units.

### The ROCK faction

The Rock faction will comprise mostly Tanks and Brawlers. Generally, they should be able to take out Rushers and close-range Skirmishers (Scissors). They generally don't like Kiters and Long-Range Skirmishers (Paper).
Their Standard Cannon weapons are relatively long range, but low in velocity.
Their Splash cannons are rather short in range and lack velocity.
They have some devastating close range burst lasers.
They've got slow but efficient thrusters.
Liken them to Crystal for now.

_More info to come after the faction is actually completed_

### The PAPER faction

The Paper faction will comprise mostly Kiters and Long-Range Skirmishers. Generally, they should be able to take out Tanks and Brawlers (Rock). They generally don't like Rushers and Close-Range Skirmishers.

## Goals:

Vanilla balance mods are great, as everyone who has played the game has played with the base factions, making the mods easy to pick up. However, it seems rather difficult to make balance changes without changing the faction's identity. I'm trying out what Owlfeathers did for his CFTs, for which he created a couple of high-quality faction mods that work great in tournaments.

I'm also using this project to learn how to use git and github, which is a skill that I want to have at my dispense!

## Installation:

This mod will be put on Steam eventually, the link will be here.

Using git, clone this repository to your `mods/` folder:
```
git clone https://github.com/SomeDebris/rock-paper-scissors

Alternately, download this repository as a .zip file, extract it, and put it in your `mods/` folder.

## Note:

Don't expect much progress on this as time goes on; I update this only on my free time.
