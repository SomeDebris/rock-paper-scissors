# rock-paper-scissors [by Debris]

Rock-Paper-Scissors is a faction mod for the game Reassembly. The end goal is to create three factions designed for competitive play, which will eventually be called Rock, Paper, and Scissors.

### deviations from vanilla faction philosophy:

A lot of base reassembly features have been removed entirely for the sake of simplicity.
- **No generator blocks.** The faction cores generate ridiculous amounts of energy already and other modules use next to nothing.
- **launchables are uncommon.** notably, No homing missiles.
- **function of shields has wildly changed from vanilla.** regen times are fast, health is low. downtime is long. Large shots and bursts can destroy them, but not much else.

### goals:

Vanilla balance mods are great, as everyone who has played the game has played with the base factions, making the mods easy to pick up. However, it seems rather difficult to make balance changes without changing the faction's identity. I'm trying out what Owlfeathers did for his CFTs, for which he created a couple of high-quality faction mods that work great in tournaments.

_(I'm also using this project to learn how to use git and github, which is a skill that I want to have at my dispense!)_

### installation:

This mod will be put on Steam eventually, the link will be here.
